        <ul>
            <li>Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. </li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
            <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup sesame seeds,</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>PROCEDURE</h3>
           <ol>
            <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Dissolve the baking soda in hot water and add to the mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in the flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake until the edges are golden brown.</li>

            <h3>ENGREDIENTS</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon instant dry yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt</li>
                <li>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
                <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
                <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
                <li>1/2 Cup evaporated milk</li>
                <li>1/2 Cup sesame seeds,</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>PROCEDURE</h3>

               <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Batter:
                  In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</br>
                  In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined.</br>
                  Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Avoid overmixing,</br>
                  as it can make the donuts tough. Stir in the melted butter until fully incorporated into the batter.</li>
                <li>Heat the Oil:
                  Pour oil into a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot, filling it to about 2 inches deep. Heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). </br>
                  Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature.</li>
                <li>Form the Donuts:
                  While the oil is heating, prepare a piping bag or a Ziploc bag with a corner snipped off. </br>
                  This will make it easier to pipe the batter into the hot oil.
                  Once the oil reaches the desired temperature, carefully pipe small circles of batter directly into the oil. </br>
                  You can also spoon small amounts of batter into the oil.</li>
                <li> Fry the Donuts:
                  Fry the donuts for about 2-3 minutes, flipping them halfway through, until they are golden brown and cooked through.</br>
                  Use a slotted spoon or a spider strainer to remove the donuts from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with</br> paper towels to drain off excess oil.</li>
                <li>Add Toppings:
                  While the donuts are still warm, you can coat them in your desired toppings. Roll them in confectioners' </br>
                  sugar, cinnamon sugar, or dip them in chocolate glaze. You can also add sprinkles for a fun touch.</li>
                <li>Serve and Enjoy: Serve the mini donuts warm and enjoy them with your favorite beverage. </br>
                  They're best enjoyed fresh but can be stored in an airtight container for a day or two.</li>
